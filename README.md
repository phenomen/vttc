# VTTC - Virtual Tabletop Converter

**VTTC** is a command-line tool (CLI) that quickly converts various image and video formats into compatible VTT formats (Foundry VTT, Roll20, Fantasy Grounds, etc.).

## Usage

**VTTC** requires [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

To use the tool, open a command prompt in the directory with the files you want to convert (`Windows: Right Click -> Open in Terminal`).

Then type:

```
npx vttc
```

The first load will take a bit longer (package installation), but subsequent runs should be instant.
